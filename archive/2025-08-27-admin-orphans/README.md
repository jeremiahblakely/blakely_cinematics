# Admin Orphaned Files Quarantine

**Date:** 2025-08-27  
**Action:** Non-destructive quarantine of unused admin files  
**Reason:** Cleanup identified orphaned files that are not referenced by any HTML/JS

## Files Moved to Quarantine

The following files were moved from their original locations to this archive folder:

1. **admin.js** (originally: `admin/admin.js`)
   - Purpose: Tab management system
   - Status: Not implemented/unused

2. **admin.galleries.js** (originally: `admin/admin.galleries.js`)  
   - Purpose: Gallery creation functions
   - Status: Superseded by inline code in admin.html

3. **admin.selections.js** (originally: `admin/admin.selections.js`)
   - Purpose: Selection management system  
   - Status: Feature not implemented

4. **admin.css** (originally: `admin/admin.css`)
   - Purpose: Additional admin styling
   - Status: Not referenced in any HTML

## How to Restore

If you need to restore any of these files, simply copy them back to their original locations:

```bash
# Restore all files
cp archive/2025-08-27-admin-orphans/admin.js admin/
cp archive/2025-08-27-admin-orphans/admin.galleries.js admin/
cp archive/2025-08-27-admin-orphans/admin.selections.js admin/
cp archive/2025-08-27-admin-orphans/admin.css admin/

# Or restore individual files as needed
cp archive/2025-08-27-admin-orphans/admin.js admin/admin.js
```

## Verification Performed

- ✅ Verified no HTML files reference these paths
- ✅ Verified no JS files import these modules  
- ✅ Confirmed admin.html and admin-login.html unaffected
- ✅ Local server functionality preserved

## Impact

**None.** These files were not being loaded or used by the current admin system. The quarantine is purely organizational to reduce confusion during future development.
